ComandLineInteraction

this library provides a command line interface for apps.
The ComandLineInteraction is the centered Class here. it takes the Input
from CommandLine and maps it into proper commands. These
commands are given to the CommandLineInterpreter, who's responsible to
execute it.

To make that concept working, the Interpreter offers a set of commands,
which can be executed.
